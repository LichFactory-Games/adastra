## It Takes A Village

We were in the middle of a pitched battle with Gwen high above, unleashing fiery havoc on the Sil militia below. The fighting was intense as we tried to flee while Gwen provided aerial support (and reveled in her wizardly power). Sil fruitlessly attempted to hit her with javelins as she remained just out of their range. 

During the skirmish, a sand spider appeared and took its pound of flesh from Ryalith and Gloopwing. Gwen's fireballs forced it to retreat after sustaining heavy damage. She then targeted the scale's leader with a well-placed chromatic orb of acid. To our dismay, the damage was transferred to one of the leader's minions, who melted into the sand, as Sarath remained completely unscathed. 

After the Sil pushed us out of their village, we retreated into the desert night. Despite the challenges, we managed to avoid a quicksand trap and found a safe camping spot, thanks to Stigs's keen eyes. Tensions ran high as we debated our next move and the repercussions of Gwen's actions. A sending stone report to our superiors left us feeling uneasy as the Dyarchy planned to "handle" the Sil village, suggesting impending mass violence.

The following day we were somewhat unsure of where to go next. We ventured further into the northern desert, staying near the foothills of the eastern Verdoun mountains, as we tried to find any sign of life. Eventually we discerned what looked like a structure on the horizon. We elected to travel to it. Our journey led us to an eerie sight â€“ a structure resembling a giant ribcage, partially buried in the sand. While Gwen and Gloopwing investigated, the rest of us kept watch. Suddenly, two familiar Sil appeared, shouting a warning about the bones. Too late, we realized it was a trap. Gloopwing was ensnared by shifting sands, revealing a monstrous sandwyrm as the bones it used as a lure began to rise from the ground and revealed themselves to be the back spines of an enormous lizard-like beast.

With Gloopwing restrained and Gwen narrowly escaping the trap, we braced ourselves for the imminent battle with the Sandwyrm!
