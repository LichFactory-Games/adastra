## Session 48 – Deck The Halls

Having reached the main deck of the Deathspider, we found ourselves faced with a long corridor lined with ominous doorways. The distant sounds of combat echoed from the cargo hold behind us, while ahead we heard the distinctive hissing of Neogi and the alarming click of chitinous limbs against metal walls.

Our attempt to reach the spelljamming helm at the corridor's end was met with immediate resistance. An Umber Hulk – its massive form a horrific fusion of insect and beast – burst through the wall beside us, its crystalline eyes pulsing with disorienting patterns. Behind it came the Neogi Void Hunters, their spider-like bodies moving with alien grace as they unleashed bolts of crackling eldritch energy.

Though Theta fell to the Void Hunters' vicious assault, we eventually prevailed against both the hulking insectoid horror and its Neogi masters. With the helm room secured, their helm destroyed (Ryalith saw to that), and our grisly bounty of Neogi heads collected, we decided our best move was to withdraw. The sounds of combat from the cargo hold had grown more intense, but after Gloopwing looked in we decided that, with our resources depleted and survival uncertain, we could not risk becoming further entangled in that desperate battle.

Our escape was aided by Gwenzahlya's magic, which sent walls of flame rushing through the corridors behind us, clearing our path to the longboat but also setting the massive vessel ablaze. As we fled into the void of space, the Deathspider burned behind us, its fate – and that of any souls still trapped within – now sealed by our actions.

Though we had achieved our primary objective, the price of our victory weighed heavily upon us. Whatever secrets or prisoners the Deathspider held were now lost to the flames, and we could only hope that the intelligence gathered about the Neogi's operations would prove worth the cost.
