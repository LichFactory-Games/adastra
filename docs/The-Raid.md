It would be great to start the adventure with a real bang -- it's a spelljammer themed adventure, so why not start on a ship and perhaps *in media res* in some way? 

I have been thinking that a cool start would be having all the characters be members of a raiding team attacking a Neogi vessel. I want it to be cinematic but also somewhat deadly. So running it a kind of gauntlet/funnel adventure would be fantastic. The difficulties that come up immediately are the following: 

- Character creation: 5e char creation takes awhile, so I would want the players to be able to create three or so characters in a short amount of time. 
- Running multiple characters: Not everyone is equipped to be able to do this, even at low levels. 
- 0 Level or 1st Level?: Should all the PCs start as just 0 level raiders and graduate to 1st? Or should we start at 1st?
	- The level of difficulty and deadliness suggests that they should be first level characters. I'm just worried that this will take too long. So the thing to do perhaps is come up with some sort of streamlined 1st level char process. 
- Use Arcadia 9's "Filthy Peasants!" adventure for ideas 

An alternative to running the PCs as raiders would be to have then either as villagers attacking a downed Neogi spider ship, or as captured peasants being taken for slave labor. 

## Monsters 

- 2 Umber Hulks 
- One [[neogi-master-mpmm|neogi-master-mpmm]] 
- 2 [[neogi-pirate-bam|neogi-pirate-bam]] 
- 10 [[commoner|Commoner]]s

This is a LOT for a group to take on, so there has to be some other environmental stuff happening to have it make sense that the entire raiding party doesn't get taken out. 

- Intersperse a few upper level NPCs 
- Have a ship-to-ship combat ensue that distracts the more powerful monsters 
- Have some folks come in and save the day if things get really bad ?
