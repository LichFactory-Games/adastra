## Session 50 - Last Resort 

Our battered Reaver vessel limped into Haven's spaceport, where an unexpected sight awaited us through the bustle of repair crews and medical personnel - a pristine Damselfly-class ship, its elegant hull catching the starlight like dewdrops on a leaf. This remarkable vessel, we learned, was to be our new home, arranged by Kalia Lebenzwort's masterful shipwrighting.

Much of our time in Haven was spent familiarizing ourselves with our new vessel and organizing its command structure. The ship would require additional crew, and each of us would need to master new responsibilities as officers. More pressing, however, was the matter of acquiring a ship's charm - the mystical device that would allow us to return to Haven's secret location among the asteroids.

After much deliberation over whom to trust with such sponsorship, we sought out Captain Puel, whom we found at his usual haunt in the Broken Compass tavern. The captain, deep in his cups and preoccupied with a seemingly endless (thanks to Ryalith) plate of fried potatoes, agreed readily enough to sponsor our charm in exchange for an unspecified future favor. Though this arrangement gave us pause, the need for the charm outweighed our reservations.

The aftermath of the Neogi raid continued to weigh on our minds as we made our arrangements. Among the rescued prisoners were several Haemin engineers, specifically targeted for their expertise in technomancy and shipbuilding. Their accounts painted a disturbing picture - the A'lhruhyn appeared to be amassing thralls for a massive shipbuilding operation on Xteczis, far beyond the scale needed for mere raiding.

Here we also bid farewell to our companion Theta, whose path now diverged from our own. His absence left a noticeable void in our group, though the promise of new adventures beckoned.

Our new ship stands ready in Haven's docks, its pristine hull promising swift passage through the void. Seeking respite from recent trials, and empowered by our new freedom of movement, we journeyed to Kalder's Last Resort at Hephaestos, a remarkable establishment built, if local legends are to be believed, upon the petrified bones of an ancient Draegon. After some spirited negotiation with the front desk clerk over accommodations, we secured a group package for the night. The Kazemi family, who run this unique establishment, shared fascinating tales of the hot springs' mystical properties. The springs themselves proved remarkably restorative, though their waters carried an unusual warmth that spoke to their legendary origin.

As we relaxed in these therapeutic waters, we couldn't help but reflect on the larger implications of recent events. The coordinated nature of the Neogi attack suggested infiltration of major power structures, while C'thaxis's presence at what should have been a routine convoy indicated something of great significance to the A'lhruhyn's plans. Whatever dark purpose drove their increased activity, we would need all our strength and wit to face it.
