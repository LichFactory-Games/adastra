> **Encounters**: Zerrenia Azhar 


After a restorative break at the Hidden Muse, we were in good spirits. We needed to make our next move, and that involved the mysterious Zerrenia Azhar. Our parting words with Velik paid off, as he sent us a mid-morning missive containing Zerrenia's address. We then sent a message of our own. Gwen, being the only one of us personally acquainted with Zerrenia, wrote a letter asking to meet in person concerning matters of mutual interest. 

Much to our delight (and surprise) Zerrenia agreed to meet us later in the evening at the Muse. We found a cozy corner off the main rooms and awaited her arrival. After a slightly awkward greeting, Gwen introduced the rest of us. Zerrenia was â€¦ difficult. Gwen seemed somewhat crestfallen at Zerrenia's dismissive attitudes towards everyone, and particularly offended by her disdain of the cards. 

Z proposed a job for us. She wanted a book she called the 'Astronomicon', and said that she had hired Velik to get it but that he had disappointed her. She was going to pay us an enormous sum, and since -- unbeknownst to Z -- we already had the book, we figured the job would be pretty easy.

She noted that readers of the book would have difficulty without the "key" that she possessed that would be aid in deciphering the mysterious language in the book, and keep one from madness in so doing. She also spoke of the need to understand the Astranomicon's contents for the good of others -- that knowing and understanding the truth of things was important in and of itself, and that this truth should be available to all. 

The bargaining was intense. Zerrenia was a shrewd negotiator, her demands high but not without reason. She seemed unconcerned with money, and was mildly insulting towards others who were. Ultimately, we came to an understanding. We would read the book together, over multiple sessions. She would bring us money for each session we met. We would start fresh tomorrow. Z left, but we were concerned for her safety so Ryalith and Karel shadowed her home, and would return tomorrow to pick her up.
