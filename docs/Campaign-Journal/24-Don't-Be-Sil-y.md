## Don't Be Sil-y

Our journey through the Kypar Desert was grueling, with the intense heat bearing down on us relentlessly. As we trekked across the vast expanse of sand, we took a much-needed break using a clever rope trick spell, creating a shaded refuge to escape the scorching sun.

Upon reaching the Sil village, we were met with a mix of curiosity and suspicion from the inhabitants. The Sil proved to be both intelligent and mischievous. They were not particularly proficient in Common—or perhaps they simply chose not to display such proficiency—leading to some challenging interactions. Each encounter, even simple ones involving trade, seemed to have an undertone of menace, and we found ourselves bartering for peculiar and unsettling trinkets, such as a glass eye and a desiccated faerie in a bottle.

Our hopes for a straightforward alliance were dashed during a tense conversation with the spiritual leader of the Sil scale. Despite our efforts, we could not secure the assistance we sought. As we prepared to rest for the night, two younger Sil approached us with a dire warning: the scale we had sought refuge in was collaborating with the very cultists we were pursuing.

A debate ensued within our group. Gwen was determined to stay behind and "rescue" the two younger Sil, although it was unclear if they really needed rescuing. The rest of us, wary of the danger, wanted to flee. After we left, Gwen's attempt at stealth failed miserably, resulting in alarms being raised and a chaotic chase through the village.

After Gloopwing heard noises coming from the encampment we had left behind, we were astonished to see Gwen high in the air, raining firebolts down on the scale militia, while the rest of us watched from a distance in the desert, unsure of what to do next.
