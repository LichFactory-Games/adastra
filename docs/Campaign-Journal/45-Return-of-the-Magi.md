## Session 45: Return of the Magi

We split our efforts this day, seeking both allies and opportunities in the tumultuous harbor of Haven. Our first stop was the Reavers' quarter, a rowdy den of space-hardened pirates. After withstanding some initial "hazing" from the locals, we struck a deal with their leader Tiran Foss to join an upcoming raid against the dreaded Neogi slavers. The promise of 250 gold for each arachnid head turned in sealed our place in the boarding party.

Seeking counsel before the mission, we tracked down Captain Frank Puel. Over drinks and victuals, he warned us of the Neogi's fearsome mind-bending powers. As we departed, Gwenzhalya suddenly materialized, transported by magic tome from the clutches of her hag mother to rejoin our band. The reunion was joyous, if a bit confused. Gwen still must catch up on all that we have done in her absence, but time is short -- there will be opportunity enough on the Reaver ship (*The Triumph*) to tell her tales. 

Our final visit took us to the palatial estate of Talah Mesho'a, an enigmatic Hozhungi exile, and the matriarch of this exiled sliver of clan Mesho'a. Welcomed with grace, we soon felt the probing tendrils of her psychic gift. Ryalith proved particularly susceptible to Talah's discerning mind, and laid bare our purpose on Haven. A sumptuous meal followed, where we met Eko, a Thri-Kreen druid tasked by our friend Nalanie to accompany us on the impending Neogi raid in Stigs' stead, as he labors to craft our new spelljamming vessel.

Thus we find ourselves poised between dread and hope, a fledgling alliance with cutthroat Reavers and an audience with a cunningly perceptive Hozhungi matriarch. The coming days will test our mettle against the horrific Neogi, even as we ponder what threads of intrigue we have become ensnared in. Where this tangled web leads, only the turning of the spheres may reveal.
