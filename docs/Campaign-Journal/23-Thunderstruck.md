## Thunderstruck

With the recent promise of absolution and the heavy responsibility laid on our shoulders, we wasted no time gearing up for the journey ahead. Our benefactor, Galen Orosen (on behalf of the Dyarchy), had seen to it that we were well-equipped. Each of us received an array of magical items that we inspected with great enthusiasm. There was something special for every one of us. 

Shortly after, we boarded the airship at Omerth's mooring. The initial excitement of taking to the skies was quickly tempered by the harsh winds of The Strom. Much to our embarrassment a few of us got a bit airsick. Lieutenant Coriolis had warned us about this and just gave us encouraging words while reminding us to not get sick on the deck. As we adjusted to the flight, our voyage took a violent turn. A group of Blitzits—sometime called spark mephits—ambushed us. The airship deck became a battleground as these creatures attacked, crackling with electric fury.

The fight was tougher than we anticipated. The crew deployed on the bow deck while we took the aft. Gwen, enlarged into giant form and caught in the thick of it, bore the brunt of their assault but managed to retaliate with a powerful Thunder Wave. Her spell cleared much of the deck, disintegrating seven Blitzits in a resounding boom that echoed through the stormy skies. Stigs and Reason treated the Blitzits as bowling practice, knocking several off with Reason's powerful charge. Gloopwing and Ryalith took cleanup, bashing the remaining Blitzits off the ship, or destroying them entirely. 

We landed in the Kypar Desert with our bodies and gear worse for wear but spirits still high, thanks to our victory. Lieutenant Coriolis offered a stern reminder of the desert’s dangers before leaving us to our mission. We quickly consulted both spiritual and intellectual guides—Gwen sought insights from the spirits, and Stigs discussed strategies with his companion, Reason. Both sources pointed us northeast towards a potential Sil encampment.

As we trekked through the desert, its vast, arid expanse unfolded around us, testing our resolve and readiness. Despite the day’s trials, there was a sense of anticipation among the group. The Kypar Desert was proving to be as challenging as it was mysterious, and whatever lay ahead, we knew our journey was only just beginning.
