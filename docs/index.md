Welcome to the website for the *Ad Astra* campaign. Here you'll find:

- An almanac for the fictional wildspace system "Erspace" in which my campaigns are based. 
- A list of custom character options (including custom races and classes/subclasses) and my table rules for 5e. You can find more complete mechanics and info on the [compendium site](https://5e-compendium.lichfactory.com). 
- Some info on using [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com), that should hopefully be helpful to players new to the system. I'll also post here notes on my use of Foundry, preferred modules and macros, etc.
