## Temple of Doom

As our footsteps echoed on the worn stone steps, the faint light ahead grew brighter. The steps, feeling as if they had been grown directly out of the claustrophobically close cavern walls, led us into a larger open cavern. Before us lay a series of glowing pods, electricity arcing across them, tended to by several acolytes. Stigs was directed toward a group of pods on the far wall, his sacrifice seemingly imminent. The suggestion seemed to be that whatever was in those pods would soon be in Stigs. 

The cultists, clad in their dark robes, transported bio-material and lab supplies, their faces hidden in shadow. As Stigs was pushed forward, it became clear that his "sacrifice" involved having his brain consumed. The mild-mannered artificer drew his wheellock pistol and fired both barrels at one of the "awakened" cultists, their eyes glowing with an eerie light, and we found ourselves thrust into battle.

Gloopwing, maintaining her ruse, pretended to scold Stigs, while causing confusion and chaos by telekinetically hurling one of the gestation pods at the cultists. Invisible, Gwen and Ryalith moved into position, ready to strike. The cavern was filled with the sounds of battle as we faced a formidable group of enemies: two awakened cultists with deadly psi-force bolts, four Sil lizardfolk warriors with glistening scales and sharp claws, four cultist acolytes, and a towering brain golem, its grotesque form pulsating with psychic energy.

The fight was brutal. Stigs, after his initial attack, took a sniper position on the cavern wall, using his spider climb ability. Gloopwing's telekinetic abilities moved Ryalith out of harm's way, avoiding a flurry of attacks. Gwen, standing back, cast a devastating fireball that decimated the weaker cultists and wounded the awakened cultists severely. The odds began to turn in our favor.

As the last of the low-power threats fell, Gloopwing continued her act, convincing one of the remaining awakened cultists to let her help him. She then telekinetically hurled him into the brain golem. At this point, we believed we had the upper hand, until the brain golem unleashed a psychic blast. Ryalith, caught off guard, barely managed to stay conscious thanks to her quick reflexes and ability to quickly recover. Stigs' armored companion was stunned, and Gloopwing took heavy damage despite her successful save.

Focused fire on the brain golem became our only hope. Ryalith and Gloopwing went down, their bodies limp on the cold stone floor. Gwen took a critical hit from the remaining awakened cultist, but her shield spell saved her from further harm. Stigs continued to snipe from his elevated position, and with precise shots and Gwenâ€™s remaining spells, we finally reduced the brain golem to a quivering mass.

With the immediate threat neutralized, we went after the fleeing awakened cultist. In a heroic maneuver Stigs shot and then grappled the awakened one. Ryalith then put him down for the count. The cavern was ours, and we secured the area, discovering a well-like vertical passage at one end and a ladder at the other. We took a short rest. During this time we knew we would need to heal and prepare for the next deadly challenge.

In the aftermath of our fierce battle the air in the cavern was thick with the smell of burnt flesh and ozone. We steeled ourselves for the challenges ahead, knowing that the fate of Ermis rested on our shoulders. The temple of Hodos held more secrets and dangers, but we were ready to face them head-on.
