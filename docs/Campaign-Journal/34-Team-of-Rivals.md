## Team of Rivals

Our journey continued as we tried to rest in the caverns, seeking some much-needed respite. Zerrenia, a wizard whom we disliked but who had saved our lives, pretended to meditate. However, after a few hours, she quietly headed toward the upper east passage. Meanwhile, her companions, Braaca (a cunning Soulknife) and Gronk (a zealot Barbarian), camped in a northern corner of the cavern.

Gwenzahlya, ever suspicious of Zerrenia’s intentions, confronted her as she moved. Zerrenia tried to explain her knowledge about the ancient ones, insisting that we should find an alternative route deeper into the planet instead of using the gate. Gwenzahlya, eager to be the hero, argued for charging through the gate. The argument quickly escalated.

In a sudden betrayal, Zerrenia secretly cast Dominate Person on Gwenzahlya, ordering her to stop us. Suspicion turned to chaos as we realized what had happened. Gwenzahlya, under Zerrenia’s control, cast Slow on us, but we resisted the spell. Gronk, with his immense strength, waded into battle, dealing significant damage. Gwenzahlya managed to break free from the Dominate spell after being lightly injured by Stigs's pet robot, Reason.

Stigs, with his wheellock pistol, fired multiple shots at Zerrenia, leaving her severely wounded. Gwenzahlya also retaliated with a fireball aimed directly at Zerrenia. Meanwhile, Gloopwing, using telekinesis, stripped Zerrenia of her robe and bags, then set them on fire. Most of Zerrenia’s possessions, including her spellbook, were destroyed. Braaca managed to save one book, the *Arcanum Itinerum*, but everything else was lost.

We were left in a standoff with Zerrenia hiding further down the cavern passage, now invisible. Braaca and Gronk followed her, ready to fight us off. We were strategizing our next move, with tensions high and trust shattered.

Prior to the confrontation, Zerrenia had reviews what we knew about the ancient ones and the potential catastrophe of summoning Hodos. We face a tough decision: we need Zerrenia's help, but her betrayal makes it hard to see how we can ever trust her again.
