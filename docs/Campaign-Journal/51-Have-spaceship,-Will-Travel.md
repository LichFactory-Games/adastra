## Have Spaceship, Will Travel

Our night at the Last Resort proved more eventful than anticipated. The mineral springs, built atop what locals claim are the bones of an ancient red draegon, blessed (or perhaps cursed) us each with vivid dreams. The visions were unsettling – shadows and wraiths, great breathing fires, repeating cycles of time, and incomplete mechanical puzzles – all dreams that seemed to speak to each of our deepest concerns.

While exploring the springs, we discovered some of their more unusual properties. The Kazemi family who runs the resort shared tales of prophetic visions granted by certain pools, though Yasmin Kazemi's recent dreams of "the stars going dark" gave us pause. Our investigation of the springs ended rather abruptly when our activities (in this case Gwen turning Gloopwing invisible so that she could sneak away) drew the attention of the management, resulting in our swift departure from the premises. Gwen had a perhaps prophetic vision of a pyramid in the desert, and was happy to fixate on that and ignore the chaos she was encouraging around her. 

During the confusion, we became separated from Gloopwing, who had ventured deep into the cave network beneath the springs. After organizing a search party, we eventually reunited with our companion, who emerged carrying a peculiar crystalline object that pulsed with an inner light - perhaps a relic of the ancient draegon said to rest beneath the springs.

Following this adventure, we returned to Haven and made two significant contacts in our search for the artifact. First, we negotiated terms with a Haemin engineer named Dafydd Glydwyr, whose technical expertise should prove valuable to our crew. We then sought audience with Talah Mesho'a, the enigmatic leader of clan Mesho'a. She shared tales of an ancient ziggurat in the vast Na'Kho'zha desert of Andromea, believed to be part of a ancient city the Hozhungi call Cynedicia - the City of the Lost. According to legend, this pyramid sits atop one of Andromea's largest underground lakes, though no expedition sent to find it has ever returned.

The Mesho'a clan's interest in this location runs deeper than mere archaeology - their ancient texts suggest their ancestors helped construct the ziggurat, and prophecies speak of reclaiming some manner of "celestial heritage." Talah has commissioned us to retrieve an artifact from this location, offering 5000 gold pieces (or whatever else we want) for its recovery. Whether we can trust her intentions remains to be seen, but the prospect of exploring this legendary site proves too intriguing to resist.
