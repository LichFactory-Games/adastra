## Session 43: Ship Happens

After the harrowing events at the time-twisted tower, we found ourselves welcomed aboard the *Zepenth* by Drek, their newly (self-)appointed bosun and first mate. The crew celebrated our arrival with a feast of gratitude for saving their vessel, during which Ryalith sampled perhaps too generously from their stores of spirits, while Xor, ever the innovator, demonstrated that his brain jar could indeed serve as an effective vessel for mead.

Captain Puel offered us passage to Haven, though the journey would require our aid in protecting his undermanned vessel. As we traversed the void between worlds, we discovered vast nets strung between asteroids like cosmic spider webs, their purpose unknown but unsettling. Haven itself proved as elusive as the stories suggested – hidden behind veils of illusion and accessible only to those bearing special charms. Once docked, we began our search for someone to repair the Sole Survivor, moving from tavern to tavern gathering names and reputations. The Roast yielded an offer from a Giff – a hippopotamus-headed humanoid whose massive frame barely fit behind the bar – while Drake's Rake provided a veritable catalog of shipwrights, each with their own specialty and price point. Our quest for the right engineer continued well into the evening, as we sought not just skill but trustworthiness in this neutral port where alliances shift as readily as asteroid dust in the solar wind.
