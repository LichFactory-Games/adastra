## Session 44: Between A Dock And A Hard Space

Our morning began unceremoniously at The Roast, nursing hangovers and piecing together the fragments of information gathered during the previous night's tavern crawl. The whispers and rumors we collected painted Haven as a delicate balance of power between the Reavers - fierce space pirates known for their crimson-hulled ships, the merchant matriarchs of the Hozhungi, and the ever-present threat of the Neogi - spider-like slavers whose segmented bodies and multiple legs skitter through nightmare tales of captured crews.

Our search for a shipwright led us to several promising leads. The Glendril brothers, Fendril and Pendril, practically fell over themselves offering deals on new vessels. Vex Kaeldren proved more reserved, his reputation for quality work evident in the pristine ships moored at his docks. But it was Kalia Lebenswert who captured our attention, her words tumbling out faster than asteroid debris in a collision. Her enthusiasm for building us a damselfly-class vessel proved infectious, and soon we found ourselves deep in negotiations for a new ship -- a [[damselfly-ship-aag|Damselfly]] -- rather than repairs to our old one.

Our artificer Stigs, intrigued by Kalia's innovative designs, volunteered to assist in the ship's construction. The decision seemed to please Tiran Foss, the Reaver leader whose recruitment efforts have grown more noticeable as tensions with the Neogi escalate. Whether his interest stems from our potential usefulness or something deeper remains to be seen, but in Haven, we're learning that every offer of friendship comes with carefully concealed hooks.

The city itself continues to reveal its secrets - from the vibrating asteroid nets that serve as an early warning system to the complex dance of dock workers in their tri-colored uniforms. For a sanctuary hidden in the void, Haven bristles with both opportunity and danger, and we find ourselves increasingly entangled in its web of alliances and enmities. Of particular note is the "guardian" Nalani Redstone, who sparked a friendly rivalry with Ryalith and has now offered to set up a meet with Nalani's matriarch, the exiled Hozhungi noble Talah Mesho'a. The mystery of her interest in Ermis hung between us like unspoken gravity.
