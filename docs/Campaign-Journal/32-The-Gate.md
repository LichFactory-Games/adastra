## The Gate

The descent beneath the Temple of Hodos had led us into the dark heart of the cult's machinations. After subduing a group of cultists and their grotesque experiments, we stood before a vertical shaft that seemed to plunge into the depths of the earth. The air was thick with tension as we debated our next move, with our captive cultist providing no answers.

Stigs, using his spider climb ability, took the lead, but soon realized the shaft extended far deeper than anticipated—almost 1200 feet. Rather than wasting precious time, we decided to leap into the unknown. The echoing sounds of something rolling down the temple stairs behind us spurred us onward. As we jumped, our wizard cast feather fall to ensure a controlled descent. The shaft, however, revealed itself to be more than a simple drop—it was a psychically powered transport passage. Despite this, our feather fall allowed us to reach the bottom safely, though some landed with less grace than others.

Upon landing, Stigs and Ryalith managed to grab onto parts of the cavern ceiling, but the rest of us found ourselves in the middle of a vast chamber. Here, a ritual was underway, aimed at opening a gate. Leading this dark ceremony was our old nemesis, Sarath, a Sil cleric with malevolent intent. 

**The Battle Begins**

Before we could fully comprehend the scene, Stigs and Ryalith launched a surprise attack. Initiative was rolled, and the cavern erupted into chaos. Sarath, with his ominous presence and powerful abilities, commanded a formidable force: six Sil warriors with gleaming scales, four Mindrot Thralls with fungal growths, six lesser cultists, and two Awakened Cultists who exuded a dangerous psionic energy.

Despite our dwindling resources, we fought valiantly. Our wizard unleashed two devastating fireballs, which obliterated the weaker enemies and significantly weakened the rest, though one of us was infected with mindrot spores in the process. Stigs took aim at Sarath, managing to disrupt his spirit guardians shield, allowing Gloopwing, our Psi Warrior, to unleash a barrage of attacks. The Sil warriors and Mindrot Thralls fell under our relentless assault, but Sarath proved to be a cunning and resilient foe. He transferred damage to his minions and reflected melee attacks, causing significant harm to our front-line fighters.

**Unexpected Allies**

Just as the battle seemed to turn in Sarath's favor, new arrivals dropped down the shaft. Zerrenia Azhar, the wizard we loved to hate, along with her companions—a soulknife rogue and a zealot barbarian—entered the fray. Her arrival was marked by her usual condescension, berating us for our perceived incompetence. Despite her abrasive demeanor, their presence provided a much-needed boost to our efforts.

With our new allies, we pushed harder against Sarath and his minions. The gate continued to widen, its ominous glow casting eerie shadows on the cavern walls. As the battle raged, it became clear that Sarath's ritual had to be stopped at all costs. The threat of monsters emerging from the gate grew with each passing moment, adding urgency to our struggle.
