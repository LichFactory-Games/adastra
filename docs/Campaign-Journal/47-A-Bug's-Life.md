## Session 47 – A Bug's Life

Our clash with the Neogi aboard their Deathspider vessel grew more harrowing as a thunderous crash announced a new threat. Through the shattered ceiling emerged a massive Umber Hulk - a nightmarish fusion of insect and beast, its chitinous bulk filling the corridor as its compound eyes flashed with mesmerizing patterns. More Neogi descended in its wake, their spindly spider-like forms skittering down the walls with predatory grace.

Though the Umber Hulk's hypnotic gaze claimed several of our number, Gloopwing's quick thinking and psychic intervention left the beast temporarily stunned. When it finally shook off its daze, the creature, grievously wounded by Theta, turned and fled through a nearby wall –– and by doing so revealed the adjacent chamber packed with thralls, their vacant eyes and slack expressions betraying their psychically enslaved state, from which we had fled. We had tried to be merciful to them by trapping them in this room, but it seems that mercy has come back upon us.

As these poor souls began pouring through the breach, we were forced to split our efforts. Gloopwing and Ryalith bravely held the line against the advancing thralls while the rest worked swiftly to collect our grim bounty - the heads of fallen Neogi that would help pay our mounting debts. We fought our way upward through the ship, finally reaching the main deck after burning the ladder behind us to slow our pursuers.

But our triumph may be short-lived. The appearance of that mysterious vessel engaging our sister ship, the Abrozennia, coupled with the Neogi's apparent preparedness for our attack, suggests darker forces may be at work.

Our raid may have struck a meaningful blow against these slavers, but we fear we've only glimpsed the edge of a much larger and more terrible design.
